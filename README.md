# ToDoLists
A to do list web site built using HTML, CSS, and javascript. This website allows users to create projects with to do items. To do items can contain a title, description, priority, due date, and a completion status. The site uses the local storage API to store the project and todo objects in local storage to save progress locally.  

The goal of this project was to practice using javascript object oriented programming principles. Factory functions and modules are used to create objects for a specific responsibility. Webpack was used to bundle the files in the src directory to the dist directory.

Languages, Tools, and more:
